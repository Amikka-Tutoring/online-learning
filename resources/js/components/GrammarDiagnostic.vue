Questions 1-9 are based on the following


1Wanting both to save on energy expenses as well as cultural desires to shift from unclean technology force heightened interest in finding sustainable technology. HVAC (geothermal heating, ventilation, and air conditioning) is one such technology. Geothermal energy can refer to the escaping of heat energy from the Earth’s core, or it can refer to the thermal energy emitted from the ground closer to Earth’s surface.

Similar to heat in Earth’s atmosphere, this energy is derived mostly from the Sun. On the other hand, the ground loses its thermal energy slower than the air. Due to this, 2temperatures are more cold deeper under the surface than at the surface itself,

3 This is something that the Earth's HVAC systems take advantage of. 2 Moving liquid via a heat exchanger lowers the temperature of the liquid, bringing it closer to that of the earth around it. 3 The system's components are rather straightforward: a heat pump that distributes heat throughout a structure; ducting that transports hot or cold 4air; and a heat exchanger, a network of liquid-filled pipes buried in the earth or submerged in water. 4 In the winter, heat is extracted from the earth and provided to the structure via the heat exchanger. 5 In the summer, the heat from the structure is transferred to the earth.5

6 Consequently, different conditions necessitate different systems. Systems can be mounted vertically or horizontally. To hold the heat exchanger pipes in the horizontal approach, lengthy trenches are frequently dug. A vertical system necessitates drilling to much greater depths by drilling straight down. Trenches are usually less expensive to dig than deep boreholes if the earth is deep enough, so this approach is perfect for circumstances where there is lots of land available. This system is very useful when the size of the land is too 7 small. It’s also used when the soil is too shallow for the trenches, or when the heat exchanger needs to be placed in water. Whatever system type is called 8for, these heat pumps give way to substantial energy savings.

Of course, geothermal energy is still criticized. Some argue that because it utilizes electric fans and pumps to transport heat, it is not fully sustainable. They think that it is preferable to invest in long-term renewable energy generation. However, saving energy is not 9 supposably a substitute for creating clean electricity;
instead, it should be a single component of a larger strategy. These HVAC systems can reduce residential heating and cooling costs by upward of 70%, and that cost reduction is a crucial benefit, making implementing these systems a decent step towards a sustainable future.
