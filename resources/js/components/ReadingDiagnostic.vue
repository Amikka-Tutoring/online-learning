Questions 1-9 are based on the following

This passage was adapted from a speech by Carrie Chapman Catt, a leader of the womenâ€™s suffrage  movement. The speech this was adapted from argued for the 19th amendment which granted women  the right to vote.

1 Woman suffrage is inevitable. Three  2 distinct causes made it inevitable.
3 First, the history of our country. Ours is a  4 nation born of revolution, of rebellion  5 against a system of government so  6 securely entrenched in the customs and  7 traditions of human society that in 1776 it  8 seemed impregnable. The American  9 Revolutionists boldly proclaimed the
10 heresies: "Taxation without representation  11 is tyranny." "Governments derive their  12 just powers from the consent of the  13 governed." The colonists won, and the  14 nation which was established as a result  15 of their victory has held unfailingly that  16 these two fundamental principles of  17 democratic government are not only the  18 spiritual source of our national existence  19 but have been our chief historic pride and  20 at all times the sheet anchor of our  21 liberties. Eighty years after the  22 Revolution, Abraham Lincoln welded those  23 two maxims into a new one: "Ours is a  24 government of the people, by the people,  25 and for the people."
26 With such a history behind it, how can our  27 nation escape the logic it has never failed  28 to follow, when its last un-enfranchised
29 class calls for the vote? Behold our Uncle  30 Sam floating the banner with one hand,  31 "Taxation without representation is  32 tyranny," and with the other seizing the  33 billions of dollars paid in taxes by women  34 to whom he refuses "representation."  35 Behold him again, welcoming the boys of  36 twenty-one and the newly made  37 immigrant citizen to "a voice in their own  38 government" while he denies that  39 fundamental right of democracy to  40 thousands of women public school  41 teachers from whom many of these men  42 learn all they know of citizenship and  43 patriotism, to women college presidents,  44 to women who preach in our pulpits,  45 interpret law in our courts, preside over  46 our hospitals, write books and magazines,  47 and serve in every uplifting moral and  48 social enterprise.
49 Second, the suffrage for women already  50 established in the United States makes  51 women suffrage for the nation inevitable.  52 When Elihu Root, as president of the  53 American Society of International Law, at  54 the eleventh annual meeting in  55 Washington, April 26, 1917, said, "The  56 world cannot be half democratic and half  57 autocratic. It must be all democratic or all
58 Prussian. There can be no compromise,"  59 he voiced a general truth. Precisely the  60 same intuition has already taught the  61 blindest and most hostile foe of woman  62 suffrage that our nation cannot long  63 continue a condition under which  64 government in half its territory rests upon  65 the consent of half of the people and in  66 the other half upon the consent of all the  67 people; a condition which grants  68 representation to the taxed in half of its  69 territory and denies it in the other half a  70 condition which permits women in some  71 states to share in the election of the  72 president, senators, and representatives  73 and denies them that privilege in others.  74 It is too obvious to require demonstration  75 that woman suffrage, now covering half  76 our territory, will eventually be ordained  77 in all the nation. No one will deny it. The  78 only question left is when and how will it  79 be completely established.
80 Third, the leadership of the United States  81 in world democracy compels the  82 enfranchisement of its own women. The  83 maxims of the Declaration were once  84 called "fundamental principles of  85 government." They are now called  86 "American principles" or even
87 "Americanisms." They have become the  88 slogans of every movement toward  89 political liberty the world around, of every  90 effort to widen the suffrage for men or  91 women in any land. Not a people, race, or  92 class striving for freedom is there
93 anywhere in the world that has not made  94 our axioms the chief weapon of the  95 struggle. More, all men and women the  96 world around, with farsighted vision into  97 the verities of things, know that the world  98 tragedy of our day is not now being  99 waged over the assassination of an
100 archduke, nor commercial competition,  101 nor national ambitions, nor the freedom of  102 the seas. It is a death grapple between  103 the forces which deny and those which  104 uphold the truths of the Declaration of  105 Independence.
106 "There is one thing mightier than kings  107 and armies" -- aye, than Congresses and  108 political parties -- "the power of an idea  109 when its time has come to move." The  110 time for woman suffrage has come. The  111 woman's hour has struck. If parties prefer  112 to postpone action longer and thus do  113 battle with this idea, they challenge the  114 inevitable. The idea will not perish; the  115 party which opposes it may. Every delay,  116 every trick, every political dishonesty from  117 now on will antagonize the women of the  118 land more and more, and when the party  119 or parties which have so delayed woman  120 suffrage finally let it come, their sincerity  121 will be doubted and their appeal to the  122 new voters will be met with suspicion.  123 This is the psychology of the situation.  124 Can you afford the risk? Think it over.
